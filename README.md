# YOLOv1 Object Detection on Pascal VOC 2012

This project implements a simplified version of the YOLOv1 object detection model, applied to the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. It involves converting annotation formats, training with limited computational resources, and analyzing results from a deep learning pipeline implemented in Google Colab.

## üìå Project Highlights

* Implemented object detection using **YOLOv1** and **ResNet18** as backbone
* Dataset: **PASCAL VOC 2012** with 20 annotated object categories
* Full pipeline includes **data preprocessing**, **label conversion**, **model building**, **training**, **evaluation**, and **visualization**
* Trained on Google Colab using pre-trained weights and fine-tuning strategies
* Evaluation metrics include **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **IoU**, and **Loss Curve**

## üß¨ Dataset

* **PASCAL VOC 2012**: 15,000+ manually labeled images with 20 common object classes (cat, dog, car, etc.)
* Data augmentation and format conversion performed to adapt to YOLO input requirements
* Labels converted from **XML** to **YOLO TXT format** and normalized to \[0, 1]

## üîß Model & Training Details

* Backbone: **ResNet18**, modified to output 64 channels
* Image input size: **448 x 448**
* Activation: **LeakyReLU**
* Optimizer: SGD with learning rate = 0.01, weight decay = 1e-4
* Training:

  * Pre-trained on 500 images for 20 epochs
  * Fine-tuned on 300 images for 5 epochs
* Loss function: Custom YOLO loss (bounding box + object confidence + classification)

## üìä Results

| Metric    | Value                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | 0.045                               |
| Precision | 0.3056                              |
| Recall    | 0.0454                              |
| AUC / IoU | Low due to limited data and compute |

* Visualization: Model did not predict accurately on most objects due to insufficient training data
* Confusion matrix and bounding box examples included

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

* Limited compute (Google Colab) led to reduced model depth and fewer training epochs
* Training used a small portion of the full VOC dataset
* Future improvements:

  * Use larger networks with more channels
  * Train on full VOC or COCO dataset
  * Use transfer learning from better pre-trained models
  * Optimize loss function with cross-entropy for classification
  * Improve visualization and evaluation with better bounding box prediction
